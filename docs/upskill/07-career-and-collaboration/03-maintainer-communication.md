# Maintainer Communication

Ask without outsourcing thinking:

```md
I traced create paste through [main.jsx](../../../frontend/src/main.jsx#L120-L152), [Program.cs](../../../backend/Program.cs#L70-L80), and [PasteStore.cs](../../../backend/Data/PasteStore.cs#L73-L101). I think the smallest safe change is X. The tradeoff is Y. Would you prefer A or B?
```
